# Model

This is where we implement the neural network model.
I will try both ``Python`` and ``C++``.


# To-Do
- [x] implement the model in `Python`.
- [x] implement the model in `C++`.
- [ ] implement the event-based version of the algorithm in `Python`.
  - [ ] define the homogeneous and inhomogeneous functions of the dynamics
  - [ ] find the probability distribution model of the upcoming neuron spike
