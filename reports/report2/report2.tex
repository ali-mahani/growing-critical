	\section{Progress}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We found a way to implement the whole process without the use of 
		the \textit{event-based} method in \texttt{Python}.
		
		\item The python version is written by dividing the time step into a homogeneous 
		and an in-homogeneous part. the homogeneous is obvious integration and 
		the in-homogeneous section is almost like event-based. 
		
		\item I started implementing the system in \texttt{C++}. In this language I can
		make the implementation \textit{event-based}. 
		I created a class \texttt{Neuron} as a new level of abstraction for the system.
		The system will then contain Neurons and using the functions that will be written
		for \texttt{Neuron} and \texttt{Nervous System}, I will implement the system.
	\end{itemize}

	\section{Problems}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item The \texttt{python} version doesn't work. I assume there is something
		wrong with the constants defined in the system; but still, anything is possible.
		
		\item The plots for $g\tau A_{i}$ don't come out as what we expect and for 
		the first run that took about $160000$ seconds, the values flew into a small 
		value of order $\mathcal{O}(10^{-2})$ and oscillated about those values for
		the rest of the time.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item I'm thinking if I implement the system in the \textit{event-based} method,
		I might be able to have a better view of what happens inside the system. So I start 
		with \texttt{C++}
	\end{itemize}
